# AI Recon Assistant ‚Äì AI-Powered Reconnaissance for Burp Suite

**AI Recon Assistant** is a Burp Suite extension that empowers security professionals to perform smart, AI-driven reconnaissance on web applications by leveraging the capabilities of **[Burp AI](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/extensions/using-ai-extensions)**. Designed to streamline the discovery phase of penetration testing, this tool enables users to ask questions about scoped HTTP traffic and receive context-aware insights generated by AI.

By analyzing HTTP requests and responses within the defined scope, AI Recon Assistant provides a high-level understanding of the target application‚Äôs structure, functionality, and potential risks‚Äîwithout manual endpoint-by-endpoint inspection. From identifying authentication mechanisms to summarizing API behavior or inferring user workflows, this extension acts as a true reconnaissance copilot.

With support for prompt templates, scoped host selection AI Recon Assistant turns raw traffic into actionable intelligence‚Äîhelping testers focus on what matters most.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Traffic Collection**  
   The extension collects HTTP requests and responses from Burp Proxy, filtered by scope and selected host.

2. **Prompt Selection**  
   Users can either write a custom question or select a predefined prompt (e.g., "What kind of application is this?", "List authentication-related endpoints").

3. **AI-Powered Analysis**  
   The collected data and prompt are sent to Burp AI. The model returns a structured analysis based on the application‚Äôs behavior.

4. **Scope-Aware**  
   All analysis is limited to in-scope data.


## üîß Usage

1. **Open the Tab** ‚Äì Go to the **AI Recon Assistant** tab in Burp Suite.
2. **Select a Host** ‚Äì Choose a host from the list of scoped domains automatically detected by the extension. If you can't see your host click "Refresh" button.
3. **Write Your Prompt** ‚Äì Enter a prompt to analyze the selected host‚Äôs HTTP traffic.
4. **Run the Analysis** ‚Äì Click the **Ask AI** button to send the traffic and prompt to the AI engine.
5. **View Results** ‚Äì Read the AI-generated response with insights, summaries, and suggestions tailored to your query.
